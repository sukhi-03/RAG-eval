What was the author's occupation before he went on his first voyage to Lilliput?,"The text does not mention the author's occupation before his first voyage to Lilliput. It only mentions that he had been condemned to an ""active and restless life"" by nature and fortune, but it does not specify what that means or what occupation he had before his voyages began.

However, based on the context of the story, it can be inferred that the author was a surgeon, as mentioned in Chapter I, where Captain William Robinson invites him to be the surgeon of the ship ""Hopewell"".","['Page 1 of 137\nPART I.

What happened to the protagonist's boat and crew?,"The boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north, and it is concluded that all on board were lost. The protagonist swam as fortune directed him and was pushed forward by wind and tide until he reached the shore.","['Page 29 of 137\nCHAPTER VIII\n[The author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave Blefuscu; and, after some difficulties,\nreturns safe to his native country .]\nThree days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north -east coast of the island, I\nobserved, about half a league off in the sea, somewhat that looked like a boat overturned. I\npulled off my shoes and stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, I found the\nobject to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a real boat, which\nI supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a ship. Whereup on, I returned\nimmediately towards the city, and desired his imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the\ntallest vessels he had left, after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the\ncommand of his vice -admiral. This fleet sailed round, whil e I went back the shortest way to\nthe coast, where I first discovered the boat. I found the tide had driven it still nearer. The\nseamen were all provided with cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient\nstrength. When the ships came up, I strip ped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred\nyards off the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The seamen threw me\nthe end of the cord, which I fastened to a hole in the fore -part of the boat, and the other end to\na man of war ; but I found all my labour to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I was not\nable to work. In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and push the boat forward, as\noften as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide favouring me, I advanced so  far that I\ncould just hold up my chin and feel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave\nthe boat another shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my arm -pits; and now, the\nmost laborious part being over, I took out my other cables , which were stowed in one of the'

On the 5th of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts, the\nweather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within half a cable's length of the ship; but\nthe wind was so strong, that we were driven directly u pon it, and immediately split. Six of the\ncrew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to get clear of\nthe ship and the rock. We rowed, by my computation, about three leagues, till we were able\nto work no longer, being alrea dy spent with labour while we were in the ship. We therefore\ntrusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour the boat was overset by\na sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions in the boat, as well as of\nthose who es caped on the rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they\nwere all lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward by\nwind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom; but when I was almos t\ngone, and able to struggle no longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the\nstorm was much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile before I got to\nthe shore, which I conjectured was about eight o'clock in the evening.  I then advanced\nforward near half a mile, but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I\nwas in so weak a condition, that I did not observe them.

What did the HURGO understand when the professor made a sign for food?,"The HURGO understood that the professor wanted him to drink, as he had previously done with the barrels of liquor.","[""Page 71 of 137\nwas a shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into  a rhomboids ,\nand a pudding into a cycloid.

I was soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.\nAfter dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the king's order,\nattended by a flapper. He brought with him pen, ink, and paper, and three or four books,\ngiving me to understand by signs, that he was sent to teach me the language. We sat together\nfour hours, in which time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the\ntranslations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several short sentences; for my\ntutor would order one of my servants to fetch something, to turn a bout, to make a bow, to sit,\nor to stand, or walk, and the like. Then I took down the sentence in writing. He showed me\nalso, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the zodiac, the tropics, and\npolar circles, together with the denomi nations of many plains and solids. He gave me the\nnames and descriptions of all the musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing\non each of them. After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their interpretations, in\nalphabetical order .

The HURGO (for so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learnt)\nunderstood me very well. He descended from the stage, and commanded that se veral ladders\nshould be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted and\nwalked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been provided and sent\nthither by the king's orders, upon the first intelligence he rec eived of me.

There were\nshoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and very well dressed, but smaller\nthan the wings of a lark. I ate them by two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a\ntime, about the bigness of musket bullets.\nThey supplied me as fast as they could, showing a thousand marks of wonder and\nastonishment at my bulk and appetite. I then made another sign, that I wanted drin k. They\nfound by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most ingenious\npeople, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their largest barrels filled with  water , then\nrolled it towards my hand; I drank it off at a gulp, which I  might well do, for it did not hold\nhalf a pint.

What did the person of high rank do when he approached the narrator's face?,"The question is incomplete. However, based on the provided text from ""Gulliver's Travels"", I can try to answer what the person of high rank (the orator) did when he approached the narrator's face.

According to the text, when the orator began his speech, he cried out three times, ""LANGRO DEHUL SAN"". After this, about 50 inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of the narrator's head. This allowed the narrator to turn their head to the right and observe the person and gesture of the orator.

So, in a sense, the person of high rank (the orator) did not directly interact with the narrator's face. However, his speech was followed by an action that affected the narrator's physical state, allowing them to see him more clearly.","['Page 10 of 137\nterror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved\nthe scimitar to and fro in my hand.

The next thing he\ndemand ed was one of the hollow iron pillars; by which he meant my pocket pistols. I drew it\nout, and at his desire, as well as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only\nwith powder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to escape wett ing in the sea (an\ninconvenience against which all prudent mariners take special care to provide,) I first\ncautioned the emperor not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air. The astonishment here\nwas much greater than at the sight of my scimitar.

Besides, I now considered myself as bound by the laws of\nhospitality , to a people who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence.\nHowever, in my thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these\ndiminutive mortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my\nhands was at l iberty, without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a creature as I must\nappear to them. After some time, when they observed that I made no more demands for meat,\nthere appeared before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty. His Excell ency,\nhaving mounted on the small of my right leg, advanced forwards up to my face, with about a\ndozen of his retinue; and producing his credentials under the signet royal, which he applied\nclose to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes without any signs of ang er, but with a kind of\ndeterminate resolution, often pointing forwards, which, as I afterwards found, was towards\nthe capital city, about half a mile distant; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that\nI must be conveyed. I answered in few words,  but to no purpose, and made a sign with my\nhand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over His Excellency’s  head for fear of hurting\nhim or his train) and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty. It\nappeared that he under stood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of\ndisapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be carried as a prisoner.\nHowever, he made other signs to let me understand that I should have food enough, and very\ngood treatment.

What was the purpose of the wooden frame raised three inches from the ground with twenty-two wheels?,"The text doesn't explicitly state the purpose of the wooden frame raised three inches from the ground with twenty-two wheels. However, based on the context, it seems to be related to the island's movement and transportation.

According to the passage, the island is made to rise and fall, and move from one place to another by means of a loadstone (a magnet). The loadstone has an attractive power at one end and a repulsive power at the other. When the attracting end points towards the earth, the island descends; when the repelling extremity points downwards, the island mounts directly upwards.

The wooden frame with twenty-two wheels might be related to this mechanism, possibly serving as a platform or base for the loadstone, allowing it to move and change direction as needed. However, without further information, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer.","[""reckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster -hall, but not altogether so high:\nhowever, I cannot be very exact.\nBesides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered a smaller one to be\nmade for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high, for the convenience of travelling;\nbecause the other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitch's lap, and cumbersome in the\ncoach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance. T his\ntravelling -closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of three of the squares,\nand each window was latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long\njourneys. On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong staples w ere fixed, through\nwhich the person that carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a leathern belt,\nand buckled it about his waist.

And this was the\nfirst time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and ministers.\nIt is to be observed, that these ambassador s spoke to me, by an interpreter, the languages of\nboth empires differing as much from each other as any two in Europe, and each nation\npriding itself upon the antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongue, with an avowed\ncontempt for that of their nei ghbour; yet our emperor, standing upon the advantage he had got\nby the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to deliver their credentials, and make their speech,\nin the Lilliputian tongue. And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of trade\nand commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of exiles which is mutual\namong them, and from the custom, in each empire, to send their young nobility and richer\ngentry to the other, in order to polish themselves by seeing the world, and und erstanding men'

After about two hours the court retired, and I was\nleft with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble,\nwho were very impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them had the\nimpudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat on the ground by the door of my house,\nwhereof one very narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordered six of the r ingleaders\nto be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands;\nwhich some of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt -ends of their\npikes into my reach. I took them all in my right hand, put fiv e of them into my coat -pocket;\nand as to the sixth, I made a countenance as if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled\nterribly, and the colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me\ntake out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking mildly, and immediately\ncutting the strings he was bound with, I set him gently on the ground, and away he ran.

He replied, ""that, by the laws of the kingdom, I\nmust be searched by two of his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my\nconsent and assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice, as to\ntrust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me, should be returned when I\nleft the country, or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them."" I took up the two\nofficers in my hands, put them first into my  coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket\nabout me, except my two fobs, and another secret pocket, which I had no mind should be\nsearched, wherein I had some little necessaries that were of no consequence to any but\nmyself.

What strange figures were cut into the huge pieces of iron sticking out of the pillar?,"The text doesn't explicitly mention what strange figures were cut into the huge pieces of iron. However, based on the context, it seems that these figures might be related to the loadstone's properties or the island's movements.

From the passage, we know that the loadstone has an attractive and repulsive power at its sides, which is used to control the island's movement. The text also mentions that the island can move obliquely when the position of the stone is oblique, with forces acting in lines parallel to its direction.

Given this information, it's possible that the strange figures cut into the huge pieces of iron are related to the loadstone's properties or the island's movements. However, without more context, we can't determine what these figures specifically represent.","['Page 9 of 137\nabout the length of a man, fastened to a strong p iece of timber larger than the pillar; and upon\none side of the pillar, were huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into strange figures, which we\nknow not what to make of. In the left pocket, another engine of the same kind. In the smaller\npocket on the ri ght side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different\nbulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my\ncomrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly\nshaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of\nhis pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the\nother there appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness o f our heads. Within\neach of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him\nto show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He took them out of\ntheir cases, and told us, that in his own country his p ractice was to shave his beard with one\nof these, and cut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter:\nthese he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover, but\nsqueezed close by the pressure  of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver chain,\nwith a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom.

Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to\nshow their skill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty. Flimnap,\nthe treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope, at least an inch higher than any\nother lord in the whole empire. I have seen him do the summerset several times together,\nupon a trencher fixed on a rope which is no thicker than a common pack -thread in England.\nMy friend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am not\npartial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of the great officers are much upon a par.\nThese diversions are often attended with fatal acciden ts, whereof great numbers are on\nrecord.

The emperor lays on the table three fine silken\nthreads  of six inches long; one is blue, the other red, and the third green. These threads are\nproposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to distinguish by a\npeculiar mark of his favour. The ceremony is performed in his majesty's great chamb er of\nstate, where the candidates are to undergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former,\nand such as I have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the new or\nold world. The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends p arallel to the horizon, while the\ncandidates advancing, one by one, sometimes leap over the stick, sometimes creep under it,\nbackward and forward, several times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed.\nSometimes the emperor holds one end of the st ick, and his first minister the other; sometimes\nthe minister has it entirely to himself.

Four times\na year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in running and leaping,\nand other feats of strength and agi lity; where the victor is rewarded with a song in his or her\npraise.

This practice is also a test of skill and agility, where even chief ministers may be required to demonstrate their dexterity. The performance is not only a form of entertainment but also a competitive display of prowess, which can sometimes result in serious injuries due to the high stakes and pressure to excel.']"
What did the emperor order to be repeated several days?,"The emperor ordered the mathematicians to repeat their calculations several times in order to confirm the amount of food required for the author's support, which was 1724 Lilliputians.","['continued to do so about a fortnight; during which ti me, the emperor gave orders to have a\nbed prepared for me.

By the same\ncomputation, they provided me with sheets, blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for one\nwho had been so long inured to hardships .\nAs the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought prodigious numbers of\nrich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that the villages were almost emptied; and great\nneglect of tillage and household affairs must have ensued, if his imperi al majesty had not\nprovided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this inconveniency. He\ndirected that those who had already beheld me should return home, and not presume to come\nwithin fifty yards of my house, without license from the cou rt; whereby the secretaries of\nstate got considerable fees.\nIn the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what course should be taken\nwith me; and I was afterwards assured by a particular friend, a person of great quality, who\nwas as much  in the secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me.\nThey apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive, and might cause\na famine. Sometimes they determined to starve me; or at least to shoot me in the face  and\nhands with poisoned arrows, which would soon despatch me; but again they considered, that\nthe stench of so large a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably\nspread through the whole kingdom.

Now the buildings of the outer court were at\nleast five feet high, and it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite damage\nto the pile, tho ugh the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At the\nsame time the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of his palace; but\nthis I was not able to do till three days after, which I spent in cutting down wit h my knife\nsome of the largest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.

What were the conditions upon which the man-mountain would be set free?,"According to the text, the conditions upon which the man-mountain would be set free were:

1. He must not depart from the dominions without a license under the great seal.
2. He must not come into the metropolis without express order, at which time the inhabitants would have two hours warning to keep within doors.
3. He must confine his walks to the principal high roads and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of corn.
4. He must take care not to trample upon the bodies of any subjects, their horses, or carriages, nor take any subject into his hands without their consent.
5. If an express required extraordinary despatch, he would be obliged to carry the messenger and horse on a six-day journey once in every moon, and return the messenger back (if so required) safe to the imperial presence.
6. He must be an ally against the enemies of Blefuscu and do his utmost to destroy their fleet.
7. He must aid and assist the workmen in helping to raise certain great stones for covering the wall of the principal park and other royal buildings.
8. He must deliver an exact survey of the circumference of the dominions by a computation of his own paces round the coast within two moons' time.

Why did the emperor unlock the protagonist's chains?,"The text does not mention the emperor unlocking the protagonist's chains. In fact, it describes a different scenario where the protagonist is using a cable to guide a fleet of ships into Lilliputian ports, and later, an inventory of the belongings of a giant man is being read out to the emperor. There is no mention of chains or their unlocking in this context.","[""Page 11 of 137\nThis diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for great employments,\nand high favour at court.

Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to\nshow their skill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty. Flimnap,\nthe treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope, at least an inch higher than any\nother lord in the whole empire. I have seen him do the summerset several times together,\nupon a trencher fixed on a rope which is no thicker than a common pack -thread in England.\nMy friend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am not\npartial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of the great officers are much upon a par.\nThese diversions are often attended with fatal acciden ts, whereof great numbers are on\nrecord. I myself have seen two or three candidates break a limb. But the danger is much\ngreater, when the ministers themselves are commanded to show their dexterity; for, by\ncontending to excel themselves and their fellows,  they strain so far that there is hardly one of\nthem who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three. I was assured that, a year or\ntwo before my arrival, Flimnap would infallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king's\ncushions, that accident ally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\nThere is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the emperor and empress,\nand first minister, upon particular occasions.

They saw the ships move forward in a large half -moon, but could not discern me,\nwho was up to my breast in water. When I advanced t o the middle of the channel, they were\nyet more in pain, because I was under water to my neck. The emperor concluded me to be\ndrowned, and that the enemy\'s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner: but he was soon\neased of his fears; for the channel growi ng shallower every step I made, I came in a short\ntime within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I\ncried in a loud voice, ""Long live the most puissant king of Lilliput!""

He\ncalled it his oracle, and said, it pointed out the time for every action of his life. From the left\nfob he took out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like\na purse, and served him for the sa me use: we found therein several massy pieces of yellow\nmetal, which, if they be real gold, must be of immense value.\n""Having thus, in obedience to your majesty\'s commands, diligently searched all his pockets,\nwe observed a girdle about his waist made of the hide of some prodigious animal, from\nwhich, on the left side, hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or\npouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your majesty\'s subjects.

What is the reason behind the war between Lilliput and Blefuscu?,"The reason behind the war between Lilliput and Blefuscu is a dispute over how to break eggs. The emperor of Lilliput's grandfather cut his finger while breaking an egg on the larger end, leading the emperor's father to issue an edict commanding all subjects to break eggs on the smaller end instead. This led to a long-standing feud between the two empires, with each side refusing to eat or drink with the other due to their differing customs.","[""Page 17 of 137\nCHAPTER V\n[The author, by an extraordinary strata gem, prevents an invasion.

The conflict, known as the 'Big-Endian/Little-Endian' controversy, started when the Emperor of Lilliput's grandfather cut his finger while breaking an egg from the larger end, as was the tradition. Consequently, an edict was issued mandating that all subjects should break their eggs at the smaller end. This new law was met with great resistance, leading to six rebellions, loss of life, and even a change in the monarchy. Those who opposed the edict, known as 'Big-Endians', were supported by the empire of Blefuscu, which led to ongoing civil unrest and eventually a full-scale war between the two empires. The war has lasted for thirty-six moons, with significant casualties and losses on both sides, and it has now escalated to the point where Blefuscu is preparing an invasion of Lilliput.""]"

I made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself at his\nmajesty\'s feet: but he commanded me to rise; and after many gracious expressions, wh ich, to\navoid the censure of vanity, I shall not repeat, he added, ""that he hoped I should prove a\nuseful servant, and well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon me, or might\ndo for the future.""\nThe reader may please to observe, that, in t he last article of the recovery of my liberty, the\nemperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724\nLilliputians.

Why did the author return to his house without congratulating the emperor?,"The text does not explicitly state why the author returned to his house without congratulating the emperor. However, it can be inferred that the author was disappointed or disillusioned with the emperor's behavior, as he mentions that ""neither did I find the emperor at all displeased"" and that he had discovered a secret about the emperor's intentions, which suggests that the emperor may not have been entirely trustworthy. The author also mentions that he resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where he could possibly avoid it, suggesting that he was wary of the emperor's motives.","['As a result, I found my interest decline very fast with the emperor himself, who was, indeed,\ntoo much governed by that favourite.\nCHAPTER  VII\n[The author, being informed of a design to accuse him of high -treason, makes his escape to\nBlefuscu. His reception there .]\nBefore I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be proper to inform\nthe reader of a private intrigue which had been for two months forming against me.\nI had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts, for which I was unqualified by the\nmeanness of my condition. I had indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great\nprinces and ministers, b ut never expected to have found such terrible effects of them, in so\nremote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims from those in Europe.\nWhen I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of Blefuscu, a considerable\nperson at court (to whom I had been very serviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest\ndispleasure of his imperial majesty) came to my house very privately at night, in a close\nchair, and, without sending his name, desired admittance. The chairmen were dis missed; I put\nthe chair, with his lordship in it, into my coat -pocket: and, giving orders to a trusty servant, to\nsay I was indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed the chair on\nthe table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by it. After the common salutations\nwere over, observing his lordship\'s countenance full of concern, and inquiring into the reason,\nhe desired ""I would hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honour and\nmy life."" His speech was to  the following effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me: -'
 'Page 30 of 137\neyes; that I had fled from justice; and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived of\nmy title of NARDAC, and declared a traitor."" The envoy further added , ""that in order to\nmaintain the peace and amity between both empires, his master expected that his brother of\nBlefuscu would give orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be\npunished as a traitor.""\nThe emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an answer consisting\nof many civilities and excuses. He said, ""that as for sending me bound, his brother knew it\nwas impossible; that, although I had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations\nto me for m any good offices I had done him in making the peace. That, however, both their\nmajesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to\ncarry me on the sea, which he had given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and\ndirection; and he hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable\nan encumbrance.""\nWith this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput; and the monarch of Blefuscu related to me all\nthat had passed; offering me at the same time (but under the strictest confidence) his gracious\nprotection, if I would continue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I\nresolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where I could possibly\navoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgments for his favourable intentions, I humbly\nbegged to be excused. I told him, ""that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a\nvessel in my way, I was resolved to venture myself on the ocean, rather than be an occasion\nof di fference between two such mighty monarchs."" Neither did I find the emperor at all\ndispleased; and I discovered, by a certain accident, that he was very glad of my resolution,\nand so were most of his ministers.'

"In Lilliput, what happens to the accuser if the person accused proves their innocence?","The question is not explicitly stated in the provided text snippet.

What is the reasoning behind ingratitude being considered a capital crime in this society?,"The reasoning behind ingratitude being considered a capital crime in this society is that it is seen as a threat to the social order and the values of gratitude and respect for those who have helped or served others. In this society, people are expected to show appreciation and gratitude towards those who have provided them with benefits, such as food, shelter, or protection. If someone fails to do so, they are considered ungrateful and a danger to the social fabric.

The text suggests that ingratitude is seen as a serious offense because it undermines the values of reciprocity and mutual respect that are essential for maintaining social harmony. By not showing gratitude towards those who have helped them, individuals are seen as being selfish and lacking in moral character.

Furthermore, the society's emphasis on taxation based on personal qualities such as wit, valour, and politeness implies that people are expected to contribute to the community in proportion to their abilities and resources. Ingratitude is therefore seen as a form of theft or exploitation, where individuals fail to contribute their fair share and instead take advantage of others' kindness and generosity.

Overall, the reasoning behind ingratitude being considered a capital crime in this society is that it is seen as a threat to the social order, values of gratitude and respect, and the principles of reciprocity and mutual respect.","[""Page 21 of 137\nrelates to informers.

This lack of gratitude is seen as a fundamental flaw in character that makes a person unfit to live in society, as they are likely to harm or exploit others.

What is the education like for young girls of quality in the female nurseries?,"The text does not provide information about the education of young girls of quality in the female nurseries.

Their education does not differ significantly due to their sex, except that their physical exercises are less robust. At the age of twelve, which is considered marriageable age in their society, they are taken home by their parents or guardians. The education for girls of the meaner sort includes instruction in all kinds of work, with those intended for apprenticeship leaving at seven years old, while the rest stay until eleven. Quality families provide a certain sum for each child's education, managed with good husbandry and justice. The education of children from cottager and laborer families is considered of little consequence to the public as their primary role is to till and cultivate the earth.""]"

Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for\nmyself, and her diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen  (who had indeed but a\nweak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a\nmeal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight. Her knives were twice as long as\na scythe, set straight upon the handle. The spoons,  forks, and other instruments, were all in\nthe same proportion.

What punishment does the council propose for the person being accused?,"According to Article I of the ""Articles of Impeachment against QUINBUS FLESTRIN"", the proposed punishment is high treason, which would be a severe penalty. However, it's worth noting that the article also mentions that Quinbus Flestrin was only trying to extinguish a fire in the royal palace, and not intentionally committing an act of treason.

In the context of the story, the council's proposal seems to be more about punishing Quinbus Flestrin for his actions rather than considering the actual merits of the case. The council is comprised of powerful individuals who have a personal stake in seeing Quinbus Flestrin punished, including Skyresh Bolgolam (the high-admiral) and Flimnap (the high-treasurer), who are motivated by their own interests rather than a desire for justice.","['Page 27 of 137\nappears in overt -acts, so he accused you as a traitor on tha t account, and therefore insisted\nyou should be put to death.\n""The treasurer was of the same opinion: he showed to what straits his majesty\'s revenue was\nreduced, by the charge of maintaining you, which would soon grow insupportable; that the\nsecretary\'s expedient of putting out your eyes, was so far from being a remedy against this\nevil, that it would probably increase it, as is manifest from the common practice of blinding\nsome kind of fowls, after which they fed the faster, and grew sooner fat; that his  sacred\nmajesty and the council, who are your judges, were, in their own consciences, fully\nconvinced of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn you to death, without\nthe formal proofs required by the strict letter of the law.\n""But his impe rial majesty, fully determined against capital punishment, was graciously\npleased to say, that since the council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a censure, some\nother way may be inflicted hereafter.

In the lowest gallery, I beheld\nsome people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on. I waved my cap (fo r my\nhat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the island; and upon its nearer\napproach, I called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice; and then looking\ncircumspectly, I beheld a crowd gather to that side which was most in my view . I found by\ntheir pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me, although they\nmade no return to my shouting. But I could see four or five men running in great haste, up the\nstairs, to the top of the island, who then disappeared.

I\nslept well, and as I conjectured at least six hours, f or I found the day broke in two hours after\nI awaked. It was a clear night.

My intention was to reach, if possible, one of those\nislands. which I had reason to believe lay to the north -east of Van Diemen\'s Land. I\ndiscovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the afternoon, when I had by\nmy computa tion made twenty -four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the\nsouth -east; my course was due east. I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained\nupon her, for the wind slackened.

But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation  of those seas, bid us all\nprepare against a storm, which accordingly happened the day following: for the southern\nwind, called the southern monsoon, began to set in.\nFinding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit -sail, and stood by to hand the f ore-sail;""

However, I did then believe\nus to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good Hope, or about 45 degrees southern\nlatitude, as I gathered from some general words I overheard amo ng them, being I supposed to\nthe south -east in their intended voyage to Madagascar. And although this were little better\nthan conjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course eastward, hoping to reach the south -west\ncoast of New Holland, and perhaps some such  island as I desired lying westward of it. The\nwind was full west, and by six in the evening I computed I had gone eastward at least\neighteen leagues; when I spied a very small island about half a league off, which I soon\nreached. It was nothing but a rock , with one creek naturally arched by the force of tempests.\nHere I put in my canoe, and climbing a part of the rock, I could plainly discover land to the\neast, extending from south to north. I lay all night in my canoe; and repeating my voyage\nearly in the  morning, I arrived in seven hours to the south -east point of New Holland.

That upon\ncoming nearer, and finding his error, he sent out his long -boat to discover what it was; that\nhis men came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a swimming house. That he laughed at\ntheir folly, and went himself in the boat, ord ering his men to take a strong cable along with\nthem. That the weather being calm, he rowed round me several times, observed my windows\nand wire lattices that defended them. That he discovered two staples upon one side, which\nwas all of boards, without any  passage for light. He then commanded his men to row up to\nthat side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples, ordered them to tow my chest, as they\ncalled it, toward the ship. When it was there, he gave directions to fasten another cable to the\nring f ixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest with pulleys, which all the sailors were not\nable to do above two or three feet.""

What did the protagonist see when he returned to the creek?,"When the protagonist returned to the creek, he saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing for life to the ship.

This I was afterwards\ntold, for I durst not stay to see the issue of the adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I\nfirst went, and then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country. I\nfound it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the length of the grass, which,\nin those grounds th at seemed to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high.\nI fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the inhabitants only as a foot -\npath through a field of barley. Here I walked on for some time, but could see little on either\nside, it being now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an hour walking to\nthe end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet\nhigh, and the trees so lofty that I could make no computation o f their altitude. There was a\nstile to pass from this field into the next. It had four steps, and a stone to cross over when you\ncame to the uppermost. It was impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was\nsix-feet high, and the upper stone about twenty. I was endeavouring to find some gap in the\nhedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards the stile,\nof the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an\nordinary s pire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess. I was\nstruck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn, whence I\nsaw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on the right  hand, and heard\nhim call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking -trumpet: but the noise was so high in\nthe air, that at first I certainly thought it was thunder.

But at the same time the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment,\nto behold an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it should seem) to raise or\nsink, or put it into progressive moti on, as they pleased. But not being at that time in a\ndisposition to philosophise upon this phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the\nisland would take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still. Yet soon after, it advanced\nnearer, and I could  see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries, and\nstairs, at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other. In the lowest gallery, I beheld\nsome people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on. I waved my cap (fo r my\nhat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the island; and upon its nearer\napproach, I called and shouted with the utmost strength of my voice; and then looking\ncircumspectly, I beheld a crowd gather to that side which was most in my view . I found by\ntheir pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me, although they\nmade no return to my shouting. But I could see four or five men running in great haste, up the\nstairs, to the top of the island, who then disappeared.

What did the reaper do when he saw the narrator?,"The text doesn't explicitly mention what the reaper did when he saw the narrator. However, it does describe how the narrator reacted to seeing the old man's eyes through his spectacles, and how the people around them laughed at the sight. It also mentions that the old fellow was ""fool enough to be angry and out of countenance"" when he realized why everyone was laughing.","['one of t he reapers, approaching within ten yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend\nthat with the next step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his\nreaping -hook.

He considered awhile, with the\ncaution of one who endeavours to lay hold on a small dangerous anim al in such a manner that\nit shall not be able either to scratch or bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a\nweasel in England. At length he ventured to take me behind, by the middle, between his fore -\nfinger and thumb, and brought me within three ya rds of his eyes, that he might behold my\nshape more perfectly. I guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence\nof mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the air above sixty feet\nfrom the ground, although he grievously pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his\nfingers. All I ventured was to raise mine eyes towards the sun, and place my hands together\nin a supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy tone, suitable to\nthe cond ition I then was in: for I apprehended every moment that he would dash me against\nthe ground, as we usually do any little hateful animal, which we have a mind to destroy. But\nmy good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and began\nto look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words,\nalthough he could not understand them.

These people were not so well clad as the first, whose servants or labourers\nthey seemed to be; for, upon some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field\nwhere I lay. I kept from them at as g reat a distance as I could, but was forced to move with\nextreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I\ncould hardly squeeze my body betwixt them. However, I made a shift to go forward, till I\ncame to a par t of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind. Here it was\nimpossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven, that I could not creep\nthrough, and the beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed, that they pierced  through my\nclothes into my flesh.

Our\npeople, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, a t which the\nold fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance.

The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed animal that\ncan be conceived. However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone.

As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I\nheard something bounce in at the closet -window, and skip about from one side to the other:\nwhereat,  although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring from my\nseat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he\ncame to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and curiosity, peep ing in at the\ndoor and every window.

They all sat do wn in a circle about me, the better to observe\nmy motions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards the farmer. I fell on my knees,\nand lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of\ngold out of my pocket,  and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the palm of his\nhand, then applied it close to his eye to see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times\nwith the point of a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.\nWhereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I then took the purse,\nand, opening it, poured all the gold into his palm. There were six Spanish pieces of four\npistols  each, beside twenty or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip o f his little finger\nupon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but he seemed to be\nwholly ignorant what they were. He made me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the\npurse again into my pocket, which, after offering it  to him several times, I thought it best to\ndo.\nThe farmer, by this time, was convinced I must be a rational creature. He spoke often to me;\nbut the sound of his voice pierced my ears like that of a water -mill, yet his words were\narticulate enough. I answ ered as loud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear\nwithin two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to each other. He\nthen sent his servants to their work, and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he dou bled\nand spread it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward,\nmaking me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a foot in thickness.\nI thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling, laid mys elf at full length upon the'

He put\nthis engine into our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that of a water -mill: and we\nconjecture it is either some unknown animal, or the god that he worships; but we are more\ninclined to the latter opinion, because he assured us, (if we understood him right, for he\nexpressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did anything  without consulting it. He\ncalled it his oracle, and said, it pointed out the time for every action of his life. From the left\nfob he took out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like\na purse, and served him for the sa me use: we found therein several massy pieces of yellow\nmetal, which, if they be real gold, must be of immense value.\n""Having thus, in obedience to your majesty\'s commands, diligently searched all his pockets,\nwe observed a girdle about his waist made of the hide of some prodigious animal, from\nwhich, on the left side, hung a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or\npouch divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your majesty\'s subjects. In\none of these cells were sev eral globes, or balls, of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness\nof our heads, and requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a heap of\ncertain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we could hold above fifty of them in\nthe palms of our hands.\n""This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the man -mountain, who used\nus with great civility, and due respect to your majesty\'s commission.

I hear d several bangs or buffets, as I thought\ngiven to the eagle (for such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in his\nbeak), and then, all on a sudden, felt myself falling perpendicularly down, for above a minute,\nbut with such incredibl e swiftness, that I almost lost my breath. My fall was stopped by a\nterrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I\nwas quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise so high, that I could\nsee light from the tops of the windows. I now perceived I was fallen into the sea. My box, by\nthe weight of my body, the goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength\nat the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet d eep in water. I did then, and\ndo now suppose, that the eagle which flew away with my box was pursued by two or three\nothers, and forced to let me drop, while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to\nshare in the prey. The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for those were the\nstrongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and hindered it from being broken on the\nsurface of the water. Every joint of it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges,\nbut up and down like a sash , which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in. I got\nwith much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured to draw back the slip -board\non the roof already mentioned, contrived on purpose to let in air, for want of which I found\nmyself almost stifled.'
 'and the heat of the weather, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass,\nwhich was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in\nmy life, and, as I reckoned, about nine hours; for when I awaked, it was just day -light. I\nattempted to rise, but was no t able to stir: for, as I happened to lie on my back, I found my\narms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was\nlong and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender ligatures across\nmy body,  from my arm -pits to my thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow\nhot, and the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me; but in the posture I\nlay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little time I felt something alive mov ing on my left\nleg, which advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when,\nbending my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human creature not six\ninches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the mean time, I\nfelt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the\nutmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a fright; and some of them,\nas I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the\nground. However, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full\nsight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration, cried out in a shrill but\ndistinct vo ice, HEKINAH DEGUL: the others repeated the same words several times, but\nthen I knew not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in great\nuneasiness. At length, struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings, and\nwrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my face, I']",['The author walked gently to and fro on the bed to recover his breath and loss of spirits after the creature attacked his comrade.']
What did the old man do when he put on his spectacles to see the narrator?,"The text does not mention the old man putting on his spectacles to see the narrator. The passage describes a conversation between the narrator and an old man, where the narrator is trying to communicate with someone in a box (a ""closet"") that has been fastened to a ship's mast.","[""Page 39 of 137\nreverence to my master's guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him HE\nWAS WELCOME, just as my little nurse had instructed me. This man, who was old and dim -\nsighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better; at which I could not forbear laughing very\nheartily, for his eyes appeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows. Our\npeople, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, a t which the\nold fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance. He had the character of a\ngreat miser; and, to my misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my\nmaster, to show me as a sight upon a market -day in the next town, which was half an hour's\nriding, about two -and-twenty miles from our house. I guessed there was some mischief when\nI observed my master and his friend whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my\nfears made me fancy that I overheard and understood  some of their words. But the next\nmorning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly\npicked out from her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell a weeping with\nshame and grief. She apprehended some misch ief would happen to me from rude vulgar\nfolks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.\nShe had also observed how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honour, and\nwhat an indignity I should conceiv e it, to be exposed for money as a public spectacle, to the\nmeanest of the people. She said, her papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be\nhers; but now she found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to\ngive her a la mb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher. For my own part, I may\ntruly affirm, that I was less concerned than my nurse. I had a strong hope, which never left""

While we were ascending,\nthey forgot several times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their memories\nwere again roused by their flappers; for they appeared  altogether unmoved by the sight of my\nforeign habit and countenance, and by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds\nwere more disengaged.\nAt last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of presence, where I saw the\nking seated on  his throne, attended on each side by persons of prime quality. Before the\nthrone, was a large table filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all\nkinds. His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our entrance was not witho ut\nsufficient noise, by the concourse of all persons belonging to the court. But he was then deep\nin a problem; and we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it. There stood by him,\non each side, a young page with flaps in their hands, and when t hey saw he was at leisure,\none of them gently struck his mouth, and the other his right ear; at which he startled like one\nawaked on the sudden, and looking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the\noccasion of our coming, whereof he had been in formed before. He spoke some words,\nwhereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and flapped me gently\non the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an'

I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually\ncarried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship\nwere near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.\nI found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to be moved along; and\nin the space of an hour, or better, that side of the box where the staples we re, and had no\nwindows, struck against something that was hard. I apprehended it to be a rock, and found\nmyself tossed more than ever. I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet, like that of\na cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the  ring. I then found myself hoisted up, by\ndegrees, at least three feet higher than I was before. Whereupon I again thrust up my stick\nand handkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse. In return to which, I heard a great\nshout repeated three time s, giving me such transports of joy as are not to be conceived but by\nthose who feel them. I now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through\nthe hole with a loud voice, in the English tongue, ""If there be any body below, let them\nspeak."" I  answered, ""I was an Englishman, drawn by ill fortune into the greatest calamity that\never any creature underwent, and begged, by all that was moving, to be delivered out of the\ndungeon I was in."" The voice replied, ""I was safe, for my box was fastened to their ship; and\nthe carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the cover, large enough to pull me\nout."" I answered, ""that was needless, and would take up too much time; for there was no more\nto be done, but let one of the crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the sea\ninto the ship, and so into the captain\'s cabin.""

What did the school-boy throw at the professor's head?,"There is no mention in the provided text of a school-boy throwing something at a professor's head. The text appears to be an excerpt from Jonathan Swift's novel ""Gulliver's Travels"" and describes various fantastical scenes, including a visit to a professor who has invented a machine for collecting broken sentences and a school of languages where professors are discussing ways to improve the language.","['Page 58 of 137\nTo confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable effects of a c onfined\neducation, I shall here insert a passage, which will hardly obtain belief. In hopes to ingratiate\nmyself further into his majesty\'s favour, I told him of ""an invention, discovered between three\nand four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder, into a heap of which, the smallest\nspark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in a moment, although it were as big as a\nmountain, and make it all fly up in the air together, with a noise and agitation greater than\nthunder. That a proper quantity of this  powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or iron,\naccording to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead, with such violence and speed, as\nnothing was able to sustain its force. That the largest balls thus discharged, would not only\ndestroy whole r anks of an army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink\ndown ships, with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea, and when linked together\nby a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide hundreds of bodies in the middle ,\nand lay all waste before them. That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron,\nand discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up the\npavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on eve ry side, dashing out the\nbrains of all who came near. That I knew the ingredients very well, which were cheap and\ncommon; I understood the manner of compounding them, and could direct his workmen how\nto make those tubes, of a size proportionable to all oth er things in his majesty\'s kingdom, and\nthe largest need not be above a hundred feet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged\nwith the proper quantity of powder and balls, would batter down the walls of the strongest\ntown in his dominions in a few ho urs, or destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it should'
 'We crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have already said, the\nprojectors in speculati ve learning resided.\nThe first professor I saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils about him. After\nsalutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a frame, which took up the greatest part of\nboth the length and breadth of the room, he said, ""Per haps I might wonder to see him\nemployed in a project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical\noperations. But the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness; and he flattered himself,\nthat a more noble, exalted thought never spr ang in any other man\'s head. Every one knew\nhow laborious the usual method is of attaining to arts and sciences; whereas, by his\ncontrivance, the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour,\nmight write books in philosophy , poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without\nthe least assistance from genius or study."" He then led me to the frame, about the sides,\nwhereof all his pupils stood in ranks. It was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the\nroom. The s uperfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but\nsome larger than others. They were all linked together by slender wires. These bits of wood\nwere covered, on every square, with paper pasted on them; and on these papers were w ritten\nall the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions; but without\nany order. The professor then desired me ""to observe; for he was going to set his engine at\nwork."" The pupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an  iron handle, whereof there\nwere forty fixed round the edges of the frame; and giving them a sudden turn, the whole\ndisposition of the words was entirely changed. He then commanded six -and-thirty of the lads,\nto read the several lines softly, as they appea red upon the frame; and where they found three'

I told him, ""although it were the custom of our learned in Europe to steal inventions\nfrom each other, who had thereby at least this advantage, that it became a controversy which\nwas the right owner; yet I would take such caution, that he should have the honour entire ,\nwithout a rival.""\nWe next went to the school of languages, where three professors sat in consultation upon\nimproving that of their own country.\nThe first project was, to shorten discourse, by cutting polysyllables into one, and leaving out\nverbs and pa rticiples, because, in reality, all things imaginable are but norms.\nThe other project was, a scheme for entirely abolishing all words whatsoever; and this was\nurged as a great advantage in point of health, as well as brevity.

What did the queen ask the author about living at court?,Whether he could be content to live at court.,"['Page 44 of 137\nThe queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without me. I had a table\nplaced upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at her  left elbow, and a chair to sit on.\nGlumdalclitch stood on a stool on the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me. I had\nan entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in proportion to those of\nthe queen, were not much bigger than what I have seen in a London toy -shop for the furniture\nof a baby -house: these my little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals\nas I wanted them, always cleaning them herself. No person dined with the queen but the two\nprincesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the younger at that time thirteen and a\nmonth. Her majesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for\nmyself, and her diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen  (who had indeed but a\nweak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen English farmers could eat at a\nmeal, which to me was for some time a very nauseous sight. Her knives were twice as long as\na scythe, set straight upon the handle. The spoons,  forks, and other instruments, were all in\nthe same proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of curiosity, to see\nsome of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of those enormous knives and forks were\nlifted up together, I thought I had  never till then beheld so terrible a sight.\nIt is the custom, that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is their Sabbath) the king\nand queen, with the royal issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to\nwhom I was now beco me a great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were\nplaced at his left hand, before one of the salt -cellars.

This prince took a pleasure in\nconversing with me, inquiring into the manners, religion, laws, government, and learning of\nEurope; wherein I gave him the best account I was able. His apprehension was so clear, and\nhis judgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations upon all I said.\nBut I confess, that, after I had been a little too copious in talking of my own beloved country,\nof our trade and wars by sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the\nprejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up in his right\nhand, and stroking me gently with the ot her, after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, ""whether\nI was a Whig or Tory?"" Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a\nwhite staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed ""how\ncontemptible a thing was huma n grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive\ninsects as I: and yet,"" says he, ""I dare engage these creatures have their titles and distinctions\nof honour; they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities; they make a\nfigur e in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray!"" And\nthus he continued on, while my colour came and went several times, with indignation, to hear\nour noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France , the arbitress of\nEurope, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so\ncontemptuously treated.\nBut as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature thoughts I began to doubt\nwhether I was injured or no. For, after having been accustomed several months to the sight'
 'my beauty, behaviour, and good sense. Her m ajesty, and those who attended her, were\nbeyond measure delighted with my demeanour. I fell on my knees, and begged the honour of\nkissing her imperial foot; but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me, after\nI was set on the table, whi ch I embraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the utmost\nrespect to my lip. She made me some general questions about my country and my travels,\nwhich I answered as distinctly, and in as few words as I could. She asked, ""whether I could\nbe conte nt to live at court?"" I bowed down to the board of the table, and humbly answered\n""that I was my master\'s slave: but, if I were at my own disposal, I should be proud to devote\nmy life to her majesty\'s service."" She then asked my master, ""whether he was wil ling to sell\nme at a good price?"" He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready enough to\npart with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him on the spot,\neach piece being about the bigness of eight hundred moidores; but allowing for the proportion\nof all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was\nhardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England. I then said to the queen,\n""since I was now her majesty\'s most humble crea ture and vassal, I must beg the favour, that\nGlumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and kindness, and understood\nto do it so well, might be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and\ninstructor.""\nHer majesty agreed to my  petition, and easily got the farmer\'s consent, who was glad enough\nto have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor girl herself was not able to hide her joy.\nMy late master withdrew, bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service;\nto which I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\nThe queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the apartment, asked'

I mentioned the prudent\nmanagement of our treasury; the val our and achievements of our forces, by sea and land. I\ncomputed the number of our people, by reckoning how many millions there might be of each\nreligious sect, or political party among us. I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any\nother particula r which I thought might redound to the honour of my country. And I finished\nall with a brief historical account of affairs and events in England for about a hundred years\npast.\nThis conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several hours; a nd the king\nheard the whole with great attention, frequently taking notes of what I spoke, as well as\nmemorandums of what questions he intended to ask me.\nWhen I had put an end to these long discourses , his majesty, in a sixth audience, consulting\nhis not es, proposed many doubts, queries, and objections, upon every article.

What did the king initially mistake the protagonist for?,"The king initially mistook the protagonist for a child, specifically a young girl born three years ago, due to his small size and youthful appearance.","['after a cold manner ""how long it was since she grew fond of a SPLACNUCK?"" for such it\nseems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast in her majesty\'s right hand. But this princess,\nwho has an infinite deal of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and\ncommanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a very few words:\nand Glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out of\nher sight, being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from  my arrival at her father\'s house.\nThe king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had been educated in\nthe study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics; yet when he observed my shape\nexactly, and saw me walk erect, before I beg an to speak, conceived I might be a piece of\nclock -work (which is in that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some\ningenious artist. But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and\nrational, he could not concea l his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied with the\nrelation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted\nbetween Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a\nbetter price. Upon this imagination, he put several other questions to me, and still received\nrational answers: no otherwise defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect\nknowledge in the language, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer\'s\nhous e, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\nHis majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly waiting, according to\nthe custom in that country. These gentlemen, after they had a while examined my shape with\nmuch nicety, were of  different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could not be\nproduced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with a capacity of'

When one of them is born, it is reckoned\nominous, and their birth is recorded very particularly so that you may k now their age by\nconsulting the register, which, however, has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at\nleast has been destroyed by time or public disturbances. But the usual way of computing how\nold they are, is by asking them what kings or great p ersons they can remember, and then\nconsulting history; for infallibly the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they\nwere four -score years old.\nThey were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women more horrible than the\nmen. Besides the usual deformities in extreme old age, they acquired an additional\nghastliness, in proportion to their number of years, which is not to be described; and among\nhalf a dozen, I soon distinguished which was the eldest, although there was not above  a\ncentury or two between them.\nThe reader will easily believe, that from what I had hear and seen, my keen appetite for\nperpetuity of life was much abated. I grew heartily ashamed of the pleasing visions I had\nformed; and thought no tyrant could invent a  death into which I would not run with pleasure,\nfrom such a life. The king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends upon this\noccasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing I could send a couple of STRULDBRUGS\nto my own country, to arm ou r people against the fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden'

I cried out, as in a rapture, ""Happy nation, where every child hath at least a\nchance f or being immortal! Happy people, who enjoy so many living examples of ancient\nvirtue, and have masters ready to instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but\nhappiest, beyond all comparison, are those excellent STRULDBRUGS, who, being born\nexempt fro m that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and disengaged,\nwithout the weight and depression of spirits caused by the continual apprehensions of death!""\nI discovered my admiration that I had not observed any of these illustrious perso ns at court;\nthe black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have easily\noverlooked it: and it was impossible that his majesty, a most judicious prince, should not\nprovide himself with a good number of such wise and able counsellors. Yet perhaps the virtue\nof those reverend sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court: and we\noften find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and volatile to be guided by the'

But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious\npots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I\nshould be hardly believ ed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as\ntravellers are often suspected to do. To avoid which censure I fear I have run too much into\nthe other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be translated into the lan guage of\nBrobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom,) and transmitted thither, the king\nand his people would have reason to complain that I had done them an injury, by a false and\ndiminutive representation.\nHis majesty seldom keeps above six h undred horses in his stables: they are generally from\nfifty-four to sixty feet high. But, when he goes abroad on solemn days, he is attended, for\nstate, by a military guard of five hundred horse, which, indeed, I thought was the most\nsplendid sight that co uld be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in battalia, whereof I shall\nfind another occasion to speak.\nCHAPTER V\n[Several adventurers that happened to the author.

What did the other two observers conclude about the professor's limbs?,"There is no mention of the professor's limbs in the provided text.

They would not allow\nme to be a dwarf, because my littl eness was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the\nqueen\'s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was near thirty feet high.\nAfter much debate, they concluded unanimously, that I was only RELPLUM SCALCATH,\nwhich is interpreted literally  LUSUS NATURAE; a determination exactly agreeable to the\nmodern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes,\nwhereby the followers of Aristotle endeavoured in vain to disguise their ignorance, have\ninvented this wond erful solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human\nknowledge.\nAfter this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two. I applied myself to the\nking, and assured his majesty, ""that I came from a country which abounded  with several\nmillions of both sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all\nin proportion, and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and to find\nsustenance, as any of his majesty\'s subjects could do her e; which I took for a full answer to\nthose gentlemen\'s arguments."" To this they only replied with a smile of contempt, saying,\n""that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson."" The king, who had a much better\nunderstanding, dismissing his learned  men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not\nyet gone out of town. Having therefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him\nwith me and the young girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly\nbe true.

In the smaller\npocket on the ri ght side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different\nbulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my\ncomrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly\nshaped: we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of\nhis pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end of the\nother there appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness o f our heads. Within\neach of these was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him\nto show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He took them out of\ntheir cases, and told us, that in his own country his p ractice was to shave his beard with one\nof these, and cut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter:\nthese he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of his middle cover, but\nsqueezed close by the pressure  of his belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver chain,\nwith a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom.

What happened to the narrator when the queen's dwarf raised himself upon the frame of her majesty's chair?,"The question is not present in the provided text snippet.

However, if you're looking for a more general answer to what happened when the queen's dwarf raised himself upon the frame of her majesty's chair, it might be related to the fact that the narrator was shown ten times a day to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.","[""Page 45 of 137\nridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself dwindled many\ndegrees below my usual size.\nNothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen's dwarf; who being of the lowest\nstature that was e ver in that country (for I verily think he was not full thirty feet high),\nbecame so insolent at seeing a creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to\nswagger and look big as he passed by me in the queen's antechamber, while I was standing on\nsome table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and he seldom failed of a smart word\nor two upon my littleness; against which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother,\nchallenging him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.\nOne day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with something I had said to him,\nthat, raising himself upon the frame of her majesty's chair, he took me up by the middle, as I\nwas sitting down, not thinking any harm , and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream,\nand then ran away as fast as he could. I fell over head and ears, and, if I had not been a good\nswimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant happened\nto be at the othe r end of the room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted\npresence of mind to assist me.

But when he heard my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and\nrational, he could not concea l his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied with the\nrelation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted\nbetween Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a\nbetter price. Upon this imagination, he put several other questions to me, and still received\nrational answers: no otherwise defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect\nknowledge in the language, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer\'s\nhous e, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\nHis majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly waiting, according to\nthe custom in that country.

Sometimes they would fix upon my nose, or forehead, where they stung me\nto the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily trace that viscous matter, which,\nour naturalists tell us, enables those creature s to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling. I\nhad much ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear\nstarting when they came on my face. It was the common practice of the dwarf, to catch a\nnumber of these insects in his  hand, as schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly'

This artist is\nmuch encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.\nIn another apartment I was highly pleased with a projector who had found a device of\nploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges of ploughs, cattle, and labour. The\nmethod is this: in an acre of ground you bury, at six inches distance and eight deep, a quantity\nof acorns, dates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegeta bles, whereof these animals are fondest;\nthen you drive six hundred or more of them into the field, where, in a few days, they will root\nup the whole ground in search of their food, and make it fit for sowing, at the same time\nmanuring it with their dung: it is true, upon experiment, they found the charge and trouble\nvery great, and they had little or no crop. However it is not doubted, that this invention may\nbe capable of great improvement.\nI went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all h ung round with cobwebs,\nexcept a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out. At my entrance, he called aloud to me,\n""not to disturb his webs."" He lamented ""the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of\nusing silkworms, while we had such plenty of  domestic insects who infinitely excelled the\nformer, because they understood how to weave, as well as spin.""

Accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but\nI may truly say I ca me back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet,\nreckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing for the difference\nbetween the size of those people and us in Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at al l\nequal in proportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple. But, not to detract from a\nnation, to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely obliged, it must be\nallowed, that whatever this famous tower wants in height, is amply mad e up in beauty and\nstrength: for the walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is\nabout forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut in\nmarble, larger than the life, placed in their several  niches.

 ""Page 15 of 137\nThe emperor's palace is in the centre of the city where the two great streets meet. It is\nenclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet distance from the buildings. I had his\nmajesty's permission to step over this wall; and, the space being so wide between that and the\npalace, I could easily view it on every side. The outward court is a square of forty feet, and\nincludes two other courts: in the inmost are the royal apartments, which I was very desirous\nto see, but found it extremely difficult; for t he great gates, from one square into another, were\nbut eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide. Now the buildings of the outer court were at\nleast five feet high, and it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite damage\nto the pile, tho ugh the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At the\nsame time the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of his palace; but\nthis I was not able to do till three days after, which I spent in cutting down wit h my knife\nsome of the largest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city. Of\nthese trees I made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear my\nweight. The people having received notice a second time, I went again through the city to the\npalace with my two stools in my hands. When I came to the side of the outer court, I stood\nupon one stool, and took the other in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it\ndown on the space between the first and s econd court, which was eight feet wide.

Here the emperor ascended, with many principal lords of\nhis court, to have an opportunity of viewing me, as I was told, for I could not see them. It was\nreckoned that above a hundred thousand inhabitants came out of th e town upon the same\nerrand; and, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten thousand at\nseveral times, who mounted my body by the help of ladders. But a proclamation was soon\nissued, to forbid it upon pain of death. When the workme n found it was impossible for me to\nbreak loose, they cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a\ndisposition as ever I had in my life. But the noise and astonishment of the people, at seeing\nme rise and walk, are not to be  expressed. The chains that held my left leg were about two\nyards long, and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a\nsemicircle, but, being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at\nmy full length i n the temple.'
 'Page 76 of 137\nBut there is s till indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this country have been\nalways averse from executing so terrible an action, unless upon the utmost necessity.

Of all this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry their\nobstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned. And the king, when he is highest\nprovoked, and most determined to press a city to rubbish, orders the island to descend with\ngreat gentleness, out of a pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of\nbreaking the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their philosophers, that\nthe loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the whole mass would fal l to the ground.\nBy a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor the queen,  nor either of his two\neldest sons, are permitted to leave the island.\nCHAPTER IV\n[The author leaves Laputa; is conveyed to Balnibarbi; arrives at the metropolis.

In the meantime, there suddenly fell such a violent\nshower of hail, that I was immediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when I was\ndown, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if I had been pelted with\ntennis -balls; however, I made a shift to creep on all fours, and shelter mys elf, by lying flat on\nmy face, on the lee -side of a border of lemon -thyme, but so bruised from head to foot, that I\ncould not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to be wondered at, because nature, in\nthat country, observing the same proportion th rough all her operations, a hailstone is near\neighteen hundred times as large as one in Europe; which I can assert upon experience, having\nbeen so curious as to weigh and measure them.\nBut a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my little nurse,\nbelieving she had put me in a secure place (which I often entreated her to do, that I might\nenjoy my own thoughts,) and having left my box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it,\nwent to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance.\nWhile she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that belonged to one of the\nchief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden, happened to range near the place\nwhere I lay: the dog, following the s cent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran\nstraight to his master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground.

My fall was stopped by a\nterrible squash, that sounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I\nwas quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise so high, that I could\nsee light from the tops of the windows.

What did the queen ask the professor about handling?,"The text does not mention a queen asking the professor about handling. The text appears to be from Jonathan Swift's novel ""Gulliver's Travels"" and describes the narrator's adventures on the island of Lilliput, where he meets the king and discusses various topics with him.

However, I can try to answer your question based on the provided snippet:

And\nthus he continued on, while my colour came and went several times, with indignation, to hear\nour noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France , the arbitress of\nEurope, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so\ncontemptuously treated.\nBut as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature thoughts I began to doubt\nwhether I was injured or no. For, after having been accustomed several months to the sight'
 'Page 92 of 137\nThe despatch came from court about the time we expected. It contained a warrant for\nconducting me and my retinue to TRALDRAGDUBH, or TRILDROGDRIB (for it is\npronounced both ways as near as I can remember), by a party of ten horse. All my retinue\nwas that poor lad for an interpreter, whom I persuaded into my service, and, at my humble\nrequest, we had each of us a mule to ride on. A messenger was despatched half a day\'s\njourney before us, to give the king notice of my approach, and to desire, ""that his majesty\nwould please to appoint a day and hour, when it would by his gracious pleasure that I might\nhave the honour to lick the dust before his footstool."" This is the court style, and I found it to\nbe more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days after my arrival, I was\ncommanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the floor as I advanced; but, on account of my\nbeing a stranger, care was taken to have it m ade so clean, that the dust was not offensive.\nHowever, this was a peculiar grace, not allowed to any but persons of the highest rank, when\nthey desire an admittance. Nay, sometimes the floor is strewed with dust on purpose, when\nthe person to be admitted happens to have powerful enemies at court; and I have seen a great\nlord with his mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the\nthrone; he was not able to speak a word. Neither is there any remedy; because it is capital for\nthose,  who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths in his majesty\'s presence. There\nis indeed another custom, which I cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to\nput any of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the floor to be\nstrewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition, which being licked up,\ninfallibly kills him in twenty -four hours. But in justice to this prince\'s great clemency, and the\ncare he has of his subjects\' lives (wherein it were much to b e wished that the Monarchs of'

I o ne day took the freedom to tell his\nmajesty, ""that the contempt he discovered towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not\nseem answerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did\nnot extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed in our country, that\nthe tallest persons were usually the least provided with it; that among other animals, bees and\nants had the reputation of more industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and\nthat, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal\nservice."" The king heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better opinion of\nme than he had ever before. He desired ""I would give him as exact an acco unt of the\ngovernment of England as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of\ntheir own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he\nshould be glad to hear of anything  that might deserve imitation.""\nImagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the tongue of\nDemosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate the praise of my own dear\nnative country in a style equal to its merits and felicity.\nI began my discourse by in forming His Majesty, that our dominions consisted of two islands,\nwhich composed three mighty kingdoms, under one sovereign, beside our plantations in']","['The queen asked the professor if he understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise of rowing might be convenient for his health.']"
